A few notes on chapter 1 of *Microbiology for dummies*.

-   What's a microorganism living with host yielding mutual benefit?
    A symbiont.
-   What's a microorganism living with host causing disease? A
    pathogen.
-   What does micro refer to, in microorganism? They're a few
    micrometers in size.
-   What's a microbe? Same thing as a microorganism.
-   What does *karyote* means in {pro,eu}karyote? Kernel (coming from
    Greek).
-   Meaning of the names prokaryote and eukaryote? Without kernel and
    with kernel.
-   Unicellular vs multicellular? Prokaryotes are unicellular while
    eukaryotes are multicellular (eg humans).
-   Common point of microorganisms? All hold genetic material.
-   Where is the genetic material stored in prokaryotes? in a
    kernel-like shape ("nucleoid") floating in the cell
-   Where is the genetic material stored in eukaryotes? in the kernel
    ("nucleus")
-   Subdivisions of prokaryotes? Bacteria and Archaea. They're
    unicellular.
-   Two particularities of viruses? They're made of genetic material,
    but they're not alive on their own.

Molecular biology. Levels, ascending order: atom, molecule, nucleotide/nucleic acid/base which all refer somewhat to ACGT in DNA (ACGU in RNA), codon (formed from 3 RNA bases). Hence there are 64 possible codons, that encode 20 building blocks (molecular compounds) for proteins. That encoding is called the genetic code. Ribosomes produce those building blocks (amino acids).
